We developed our very own framework for adding entire CRUD endpoints in a matters of hours, fully tested and production ready, as opposed to couple of days. That framework also enabled new engineers to get up to speed in a matter of weeks, rather than months.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Features that used to take up to three days to develop could now be done within three to four hours.</b></li>\n        <li><b>New engineers that needed 6-8 weeks to get up to speed, now need less than 2 weeks.</b></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>For a company that was growing rapidly, and strained with resources, our technical solution quickly turned into a very monetizable product.
